# Covid19 Waiting Times

This project aims to avoid the gatherings of people in various supermarkets and pharmacies during the covid-19 pandemic. Based on the geolocation of the device, it will show the various points of interest such as supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics, bars etc., with an estimate of the waiting time and a forecast of the next hour.

**NOTE**: You need a HERE developer account to retrieve a list of places. You need also to set the environment variable HERE_PLACE_API_KEY to your API key.
